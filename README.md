Hi.. Welcome to my first GitHub uploaded project..
This ZOOM Bot will log into ZOOM via the Meeting ID and Password information given at the csv file.

How to use:
1. Open dw_zoombot.py
2. Change the directory of Zoom.exe , it should be similar to mine.
3. Open link_kelas.csv
4. Type in meeting ID and password information for your rooms. The last column is the one that will be displayed in the app.
